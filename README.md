# myTamagotchi, originally a handheld digital pet. You have a pet in this case Yoda/Yodagotchi, as the app runs so does your pet; age,hunger,happiness,energy are generative and you need to maintain your pet by 3 different events; feeding, sleeping and playing. Mechanics are different than ordinary Tamagotchi because the user is a young padawan of Master Yoda. Your duty is to take care of your Master through his journey of survival. Be aware, old guy can be a little grumpy.

The inspiration arose from a reddit post:

Variety methods and strategies for creating a Tamgotchi and seeing different types of styles used, I was interested to make a simpler version but also complexity in game mechanics where you cannot spam click a certain event to occur nor can you abuse your way of cheating in any sort. This was interesting because I wanted to know if there is any possible way to glitch the game and yes in my Tamagotchi there is a way to glitch it but it won't serve any purpose of winning the game.

Just remember to never let Master Yoda wander alone or else the force shall take him away from you!
======================================================================
If Yoda keeps dying and you want to test out the program, refer below as cheats to test out buttons:
sleep once energy is at 10
eat when hunger is at 50
play when energy is at 20

The twist to this Tamagotchi is that it's a tad fast paced.
